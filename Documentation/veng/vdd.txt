WARNING!

DO NOT USE TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW VOLTAGES

SLOWLY increase the voltage one notch at a time for a particular frequency and do stability/testing for few hours

once you have verified that you CPU chip can handle that voltage ONLY then "Set at boot"/Use init.d script.

If you dont follow above instruction your device might end in bootloop. 

Method 1: Via an app ( For example TricksterMOD )

Method 2: Via sys interface

The interface to control voltages is at:
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/vdd_table/vdd_levels

To see current voltage table use:
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/vdd_table/vdd_levels

To set voltage at particular frequency:
echo 1404000 1137500 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/vdd_table/vdd_levels
will set 1404 MHz freq voltage at 1137.5 mV

to reduce voltages for ALL frequencies by x ( here x=-25000 ) :
echo -25000 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/vdd_table/vdd_levels

to increase voltages for ALL frequencies by x ( here x=+25000 ):
echo +25000 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/vdd_table/vdd_levels

Method 3: Via init.d script

* Download attached vdd_battery_saver.zip and flash via recovery.
* Go to system/etc/init.d
* edit the 20vdd script
Change vdd variable to increase/decrease voltages at boot
for example : vdd=-30000 ( to decrease all voltages by 30000 )
You can check log at /data/local/tmp/vdd.txt
